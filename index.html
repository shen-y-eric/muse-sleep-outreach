                sleep deprivation is a pressing issue, especially among college students.
                <b>chronic sleep deprivation</b> can have <b>devastating health consequences</b>, including weakening your immune system, reducing the effectiveness of vaccines,
                and increasing the risk of obesity.

                <br><br>

                fortunately, <b>music</b> has been cited as a <b>sleep aid</b> that can help you feel relaxed and at ease. given <b>musicâ€™s accessibility and potential sleep benefits</b>, it might be a good time to 
                try adding it to your nightly routine.

                a 2005 <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15660547/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">study</a> found that in elders (60-83 years) who had trouble sleeping, <strong>listening to sedative music for 45 minutes </strong>before sleeping resulted in
                <b>significantly better sleep quality</b>. components of sleep quality included better perceived sleep quality, longer sleep duration, less sleep disruption,
                and less daytime dysfunction. importantly, there was a <b>cumulative dose effect</b>, which meant that sleep quality continued to improve every week.

                <br><br>

                a 2019 <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15660547/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">study</a> found that not only did listening to music before naps
                <b>improve subjective sleep quality</b>, it also led to a <b>decrease of Stage 1 sleep</b> and <b>increase in SWS sleep</b>, which is important for memory consolidation.

                <br><br>
                another <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12581941/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">study</a> found that in older women experiencing imsomnia,
                adding <b>self-selected music</b> to their sleep routines helped <b>reduce the time to fall asleep</b> from <b>27-69 minutes</b> to <b>6-13 minutes</b>.

                <br><br>
                a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18426457/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">study</a> that looked at <b>college students with sleep complaints</b> found that
                music statistically significantly <b>improved sleep quality</b>, and also statistically significantly <b>reduced depressive symptoms</b>

        <div class="description">
            <div class="section">
                there hasn't been much research on the underlying mechanisms of music's effects of sleep, but music in general has been shown to reduce cortisol levels while also increasing
                oxytocin and dopamine levels. these can work together to ease stress and reduce chronic or acute pain, which are all common causes of sleep dysfunction.

                <br><br>

                music has also been shown to be a helpful distraction from frustration or anxious thoughts before bed, and it can also drown out environmental noises such as
                planes flying overhead, busy roads, dogs barking, or noisy neighbors.

                here is my own curated playlist of 10 of my favorite songs that help me sleep at night. if you want to make your own, try to select songs that
                are tailored towards your own musical preferences, but don't evoke any intense emotions or memories. most studies select music that is around 60-80
                bpm, as it is hypothesized that the body may sync up with the slower beats. the songs I've selected here are 60-80 bpm. of course, everyone is different
                so feel free to experiment on your own and find what works for you. happy sleeping!
